Why do we setup Role Based Access Control for Kibelet Authorization
- Its the mechanism we used to create roles and asssign authorization. 
###  One of the necessary steps in setting up a new Kubernetes cluster from scratch is to assign permissions that allow the Kubernetes API
###  to access various functionality within the worker kubelets. This lesson guides you through the process of creating a ClusterRole &
###  binding it to the kubernetes user so that those permissions will be in place. After completing this lesson, your cluster will have 
###  the necessary role-based access control configuration to allow the cluster's API to access kubelet functionality such as logs & metrics.

# You can configure RBAC for kubelet authorization with these commands. Note that these commands only need to be run on one control node.

# Create a role with the necessary permissions:

cat << EOF | kubectl apply --kubeconfig admin.kubeconfig -f -
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1beta1
kind: ClusterRole
metadata:
  annotations:
    rbac.authorization.kubernetes.io/autoupdate: "true"
  labels:
    kubernetes.io/bootstrapping: rbac-defaults
  name: system:kube-apiserver-to-kubelet
rules:
  - apiGroups:
      - ""
    resources:
      - nodes/proxy
      - nodes/stats
      - nodes/log
      - nodes/spec
      - nodes/metrics
    verbs:
      - "*"
EOF

# Bind the role to the kubernetes user:

cat << EOF | kubectl apply --kubeconfig admin.kubeconfig -f -
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1beta1
kind: ClusterRoleBinding
metadata:
  name: system:kube-apiserver
  namespace: ""
roleRef:
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
  kind: ClusterRole
  name: system:kube-apiserver-to-kubelet
subjects:
  - apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
    kind: User
    name: kubernetes
