### Smoke testing Data Encryption 
Earlier in this course, we set up a data encryption config to allow Kubernetes to encrypt sensitive data.
In this lesson, we will smoke test that functionality by creating some secret data and verifying that it is stored in an encrypted
format in etcd. After completing this lesson, you will have verified that your cluster can successfully encrypt sensitive data.

For this lesson, you will need to connect to cluster using kubectl . You can log in to one of your controller servers and 
use kubectl there, or you can use kubectl from your local machine. To use kubectl from your local machine, you will need to
open an SSH tunnel. You can open the SSH tunnel by running this in a separate terminal. Leave the session open while you are
working to keep the tunnel active:
```
ssh -L 6443:localhost:6443 cloud_user@<your Load balancer cloud server public IP>

##### Create a test secret:

kubectl create secret generic kubernetes-the-hard-way --from-literal="mykey=mydata"

##### Log in to one of your controller servers, and get the raw data for the test secret from etcd:

sudo ETCDCTL_API=3 etcdctl get \
  --endpoints=https://127.0.0.1:2379 \
  --cacert=/etc/etcd/ca.pem \
  --cert=/etc/etcd/kubernetes.pem \
  --key=/etc/etcd/kubernetes-key.pem\
  /registry/secrets/default/kubernetes-the-hard-way | hexdump -C
```
```
# Your output should look something like this:

00000000 2f 72 65 67 69 73 74 72 79 2f 73 65 63 72 65 74 |/registry/secret|

- Look for k8s:enc:aescbc:v1:key1 on the right of the output to verify that the data is stored in an encrypted format
```
### Smoke testing Deployments
Deployments are one of the powerful orchestration tools offered by Kubernetes. In this lesson, we will make sure that deployments
are working in our cluster. We will verify that we can create a deployment, and that the deployment is able to successfully stand 
up a new pod and container.

For this lesson, you will need to connect to cluster using kubectl . You can log in to one of your controller server and use kubectl
there, or you can use kubectl from your local machine. To use kubectl from your local machine, you will need to open an SSH tunnel.
You can open the SSH tunnel by running this in a separate terminal. Leave the session open while you are working to keep the tunnel active:

ssh -L 6443:localhost:6443 cloud_user@<your Load balancer cloud server public IP>
```
# Create a a simple nginx deployment:

kubectl run nginx --image=nginx

# Verify that the deployment created a pod and that the pod is running:

kubectl get pods -l run=nginx

# Verify that the output looks something like this:

NAME READY STATUS RESTARTS AGE
nginx-65899c769f-9xnqm 1/1 Running 0 30s

# The pod should have a STATUS of Running with 1/1 containers READY.
```
### Smoke testing Pod-Forwarding
One way to get direct access to pods is the kubectl port-forward command. This command can be very useful in troubleshooting
scenarios, so we want to make sure it works in our cluster. In this lesson, we will smoke test port forwarding in our cluster. 
We will set up port forwarding with kubectl to a pod in the cluster, and we will access the pod to verify that it is working.

- For this lesson, you will need to connect to your cluster using kubectl . You can log in to one of your controller servers and     
  use kubectl there, or you can use kubectl from your local machine. To use kubectl from your local machine, you will need to open
  an SSH tunnel. You can open the SSH tunnel by running this in a separate terminal. Leave the session open while you are working
  to keep the tunnel active:
```
ssh -L 6443:localhost:6443 cloud_user@<your Load balancer cloud server public IP>

- First, get the pod name of the nginx pod and store it an an environment variable:

POD_NAME=$(kubectl get pods -l run=nginx -o jsonpath="{.items[0].metadata.name}")

- Forward port 8081 to the nginx pod:

kubectl port-forward $POD_NAME 8081:80

- Open up a new terminal on the same machine running the kubectl port-forward command and verify that the port forward works.

curl --head http://127.0.0.1:8081

- You should get an http 200 OK response from the nginx pod.

- When you are done, you can stop the port-forward in the original termain with control+c .
``` 
### Smoke testing logs

When managing a cluster, it is often necessary to access container logs to check their health and diagnose issues.
 Kubernetes offers access to container logs via the kubectl logs command. In this lesson, we will smoke test our cluster's ability
to provide logs with kubectl logs . In order to do this, we will access the logs from our nginx container.


 For this lesson, you will need to connect to cluster using kubectl . You can log in to one of your controller servers and use
 kubectl there, or you can run it from your local machine. To use kubectl from your local machine, you will need to open an SSH tunnel.
 You can open the SSH tunnel by running this in a separate terminal. Leave d session open while you are working to keep the tunnel active:
```

ssh -L 6443:localhost:6443 cloud_user@<your Load balancer cloud server public IP>

- First, let's set an environment variable to the name of the nginx pod:

POD_NAME=$(kubectl get pods -l run=nginx -o jsonpath="{.items[0].metadata.name}")

- Get the logs from the nginx pod:

kubectl logs $POD_NAME

- This command should return the nginx pod's logs. It will look something like this (but there could be more lines):

127.0.0.1 - - [10/Sep/2018:19:29:01 +0000] "GET / HTTP/1.1" 200 612 "-" "curl/7.47.0" "-"
```

### Smoke testing Exec

The kubectl exec command is a powerful management tool that allows us to run commands inside of Kubernetes-managed containers.
 In order to verify that our cluster is set up correctly, we need to make sure that kubectl exec is working. In this lesson,
 we will smoke test kubectl exec against our cluster by using it to run a simple command inside our nginx container.
 If this works, then we know that our cluster is capable of running commands inside of its containers.

For this lesson, you will need to connect to cluster using kubectl . You can log in to one of your controller servers and use kubectl 
there, or you can use kubectl from your local machine. To use kubectl from your local machine, you will need to  open an SSH tunnel.
You can open the SSH tunnel by running this in a separate terminal. Leave the session open while you are working to keep the tunnel active:

```
ssh -L 6443:localhost:6443 cloud_user@<your Load balancer cloud server public IP>

 First, let's set an environment variable to the name of the nginx pod:

POD_NAME=$(kubectl get pods -l run=nginx -o jsonpath="{.items[0].metadata.name}")

 To test kubectl exec , execute a simple nginx -v command inside the nginx pod:

kubectl exec -ti $POD_NAME -- nginx -v

 This command should return the nginx version output, which should look like this:

nginx version: nginx/1.15.3

```

### Smoke testing Services
 In order to make sure that the cluster is set up correctly, we need to ensure that services can be created and accessed appropriately.
In this lesson, we will smoke test our cluster's ability to create and access services by creating a simple testing service, and 
accessing it using a node port. If we can successfully create the service and use it to access our nginx pod, then we will know that
 our cluster is able to correctly handle services!

 For this lesson, you will need to connect to cluster using kubectl . You can log in to one of your controller servers and use it
 there, or you can use from your local machine. To use kubectl from your local machine, you will need to open an SSH tunnel.

 You can open the SSH tunnel by running this in a separate terminal. Leave the session open while you are working to keep the
 tunnel active:

```
ssh -L 6443:localhost:6443 cloud_user@<your Load balancer cloud server public IP>

- First, create a service to expose the nginx deployment:

kubectl expose deployment nginx --port 80 --type NodePort

- Get the node port assigned to the newly-created service and assign it to an environment variable:

kubectl get svc

- The output should look something like this:

NAME TYPE CLUSTER-IP EXTERNAL-IP PORT(S) AGE
kubernetes ClusterIP 10.32.0.1 <none> 443/TCP 20d
nginx NodePort 10.32.0.81 <none> 80:32642/TCP 2m

- Look for the service called nginx in that output. Under PORT(S) , look for the second port, listed after 80: . 
In the example above, it is 32642. That is the node port, so make note of that value since you will need it in a moment.

- Next, log in to one of your worker servers and make a request to the service using the node port. Be sure to replace
 the placeholder with the actual node port:

curl -I localhost:<node port>

- You should get an http 200 OK response.
```
