Kubernetes Supports the ability to encrpypt data at rest. 
- This means that secrets are encrypted so that they never stored on disc in plaint text. - more info on secret encryption in k8 doumentation

##### Generation the DAta Encryption Config file.

cd ~/kthw. 

##### In order to make use of Kubernetes' ability to encrypt sensitive data at rest, you need to provide Kubernetes with an encrpytion key using a data encryption config file. This lesson walks you through the process of creating a encryption key and storing it in the necessary file, as well as showing how to copy that file to your Kubernetes controllers. After completing this lesson, you should have a valid Kubernetes data encryption config file, and there should be a copy of that file on each of your Kubernetes controller servers.

##### Generate the Kubernetes Data encrpytion config file containing the encrpytion key:

ENCRYPTION_KEY=$(head -c 32 /dev/urandom | base64)
echo ENCRYPTION_KEY = See result of the variable.

Generate an encryption file to store the variable from the result above 
cat > encryption-config.yaml << EOF
kind: EncryptionConfig
apiVersion: v1
resources:
  - resources:
      - secrets
    providers:
      - aescbc:
          keys:
            - name: key1
              secret: ${ENCRYPTION_KEY}
      - identity: {}
EOF


##### Copy the file to both controller servers:

scp encryption-config.yaml cloud_user@<controller 1 public ip>:~/

scp encryption-config.yaml cloud_user@<controller 2 public ip>:~/
