Command line tool (kubectl)
Kubernetes provides a command line tool for communicating with a Kubernetes cluster's control plane, using the Kubernetes API.

This tool is named kubectl.

For configuration, kubectl looks for a file named config in the $HOME/.kube directory. You can specify other kubeconfig files by
setting the KUBECONFIG environment variable or by setting the --kubeconfig flag.

This overview covers kubectl syntax, describes the command operations, and provides common examples. For details about each command,
including all the supported flags and subcommands, see the kubectl reference documentation.

For installation instructions, see Installing kubectl; for a quick guide, see the cheat sheet. If you're used to using the
docker command-line tool, kubectl for Docker Users explains some equivalent commands for Kubernetes.



# There are a few steps to configuring a local kubectl installation for managing a remote cluster.
 This lesson will guide you through that process. After completing this lesson, you should have a local kubectl installation
 that is capable of running kubectl commands against your remote Kubernetes cluster.

# In a separate shell, open up an ssh tunnel to port 6443 on your Kubernetes API load balancer:

ssh -L 6443:localhost:6443 cloud_user@<your Load balancer cloud server public IP> 

#Limitation - cloud_server don't allow access to 6443.
Now, the problem is these cloud servers are always changing their IPs. And, also, they don't allow access to the port 6443,
which we used for our Kubernetes API server. So we're going to have to do a little bit of a workaround to get around that.
And the way that we're going to get around that for this lesson is we're going to set up an SSH tunnel.
So the first thing I want to do is I want to go ahead and set up that SSH tunnel.

# You can configure your local kubectl in your main shell like so.

cd ~/kthw

kubectl config set-cluster kubernetes-the-hard-way \
  --certificate-authority=ca.pem \
  --embed-certs=true \
  --server=https://localhost:6443

kubectl config set-credentials admin \
  --client-certificate=admin.pem \
  --client-key=admin-key.pem

kubectl config set-context kubernetes-the-hard-way \
  --cluster=kubernetes-the-hard-way \
  --user=admin

kubectl config use-context kubernetes-the-hard-way

# Verify that everything is working with:

kubectl get pods

kubectl get nodes

kubectl version
